# React Native Project: Mobile Flashcards

## Description

This was done for the final project for the React Nanodegree Program.

It is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

#### Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

```sh
# git clone the repository e.g. into a <projects> folder
cd <projects>
# git clone with ssh
git@github.com:chrisbrine/mobile-flashcards.git

# or git clone with HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/chrisbrine/mobile-flashcards.git

# change directory into the cloned repo
cd mobile-flashcards

# install the dependencies
yarn install
```

## Develop

### How to run

From the terminal, in the project folder:
